Contains config files

Useful tools:
autorandr - make the monitors change config automatically depending on the outputs connected
rofi - window selector
polybar - customizable status bar
pqiv - image preview
ranger - file browsing
tty-clock - clock in the command line
cool-retro-term - retro terminal
neofetch - get system information (replaced by fastfetch in the newer versions)


Dealing with multiple monitors and autorandr:
1. If a new monitor is installed, the configs need to be regenerated.
2. Using postswitch it's possbile to save specific wallpapers for each monitor setup.
